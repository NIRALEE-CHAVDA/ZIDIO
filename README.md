# Zidio Development Internship Projects

This repository contains projects developed during my internship at **Zidio**, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning and recommendation algorithms. The primary projects I contributed to include:

## Projects

### 1. Digit Recognition
A machine learning project focused on classifying handwritten digits using popular classification algorithms. The model was trained on the MNIST dataset and evaluated for accuracy and efficiency in image recognition tasks.

**Key Components:**
- Preprocessing and feature extraction from image data.
- Implementing and fine-tuning neural network models (e.g., CNNs).
- Evaluating model performance and accuracy.

### 2. Recommendation System
A collaborative filtering-based recommendation system aimed at suggesting relevant content to users based on their preferences. This system incorporates user-item interactions to predict and recommend content.

**Key Components:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Collaborative filtering techniques (user-based and item-based).
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE.
